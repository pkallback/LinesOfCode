Algorithm Finding Code Files from MSVS Solution file

1. When opening the .sln file, save the absolute path of the file.
2. When reading the .sln file, look for the line: 
	Project("UUID-solution") = "ProjName", "Relpath.vcxproj,", "UUID-project"
	In the solution there can be many subprojects so iterate until the line
	EndProject is found.
3a. For each Project open the .vcxproj.filters file, save the absolute path of
	the file. Look for all <Filter> containing <Extensions>. In the <Filter>
	tag save the key-value Include, which is associated to the <Extensions>.
	Iterate through the <Filters> containing <Extensions> and save them.
3b. Iterate through the .vcxproj.filters file and look for <ClInclude> with the
	the key Include. The key-value is the actual file. Match the extension
	with the <Extensions> value during 3. and save the file with the specific
	Filter category.
4.	For each file and for each line, categorize 'Blank', 'Comment', and 'Code'.

For each project, precent each file with:
|Project|Filename|Filetype|Extension|Lines|Blank|Comment|Code|

.vcxproj.filters rules (xml):
<Filter Include="Source Files"> 
tag, key and key-value

<Extensions>cpp;c;cc;cxx;def;odl;idl;hpj;bat;asm;asmx</Extensions>
values of extensions in between tag and end-tag

<ClInclude Include="stdafx.h">
tag, key and key-value
